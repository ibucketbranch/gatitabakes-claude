## 3. Auto-Run Commands
- Auto-run commands in the cursor IDE and where possible, unless restricted by operating system or security boundaries.

- Before starting a new day of coding, create a new branch named `<YYYYMMDD.x>` (e.g., `20250509.1`).
- If branching more than once in a day, increment the `.x` (e.g., `20250509.2`).

## 8. UI Mockups and Design Consistency
- When the user requests changes to UI or flow, always refer to the UI folder with mockups (`/Users/michaelvalderrama/Websites/Claude/UI`).
- Code must reflect the look, feel, and style of the mockups in this folder.
- If the code does not match the mockup, continue iterating until it does, following the principles and design shown in the mockups.

## 9. Auto-Proceed with Next Steps
- Proceed with the next logical improvements or steps without asking for permission.
- Only ask for user input on major decisions that could significantly impact the project direction or functionality.
- Use professional judgment to determine what constitutes a "major decision" requiring user input.
